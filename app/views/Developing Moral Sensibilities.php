        <p> At <b>Wonder World Play Centre</b>, we believe children need to nurture their moral sensibilities from a 
		very young age. Our teachers and educators care dearly about the children, speak to them with soft voices 
		and use gentle gestures. Each child feels they are loved and connected with the teachers and educators. The 
		children learn to be kind and caring about each otherâ€™s needs and their community. They develop a sense 
		of morality from story-telling and quality picture books and develop their own characters with the help 
		of educator modelling. </p>
