	<h3>Centre Philosophy</h3>
       <p><b>Wonder World Play Centre</b> aims to provide a caring, loving, nurturing environment stimulated by creative 
	   play, art and craft activities, cooking, story-telling and singing and music movement.</p>
<p><b>Respectful Relationships with Children:</b> Educators show respect to each individual child by respecting their views, 
giving them choices and being attentive to their needs.</p>
<p><b>Respecting Family’s Beliefs and Values: </b>We welcome all families and respect family beliefs and values by
 honouring their history, culture, language, traditions, child-rearing practices and lifestyle choices. 
 Educators work in partnership with parents, value parents’ ideas, share insights and engage them in decision 
 making.</p>
<p><b>Diverse, Equitable and Inclusive: </b>The Centre values diversity, equity and inclusiveness. We promote cultural 
inclusiveness by observing and celebrating different cultural festivals.</p>
<p><b>Children’s Rights: </b>The Centre values children’s rights in decision making and regards children as powerful 
learners. Educators respect children’s choices and support them to make informed decisions on matters that affect 
them.</p>
<p><b>Promoting Fundamental Human Values: </b>The Centre’s programmes promote the fundamental human values of 
kindness, respect, caring, giving, contribution, tolerance and harmony. Our room setting and play materials and 
outdoor natural environment creates a loving and warm feeling for children and parents. Staff model kindness and 
helping each other, and children are encouraged to participate in all domestic activities.</p>
<p><b>Natural Environment and Sustainable Education:</b> Children’s learning is connected with families, the 
community and the world of nature. The natural environment setting provides opportunities for children to explore
 and discover its wonders. We support children to understand what sustainability is by saving water and energy,
 and by recycling materials.</p>
<p><b>Health and Safety:</b> We actively promote healthy eating, active play and high standards of hygiene in our 
programme. Children participate in a cooking experience weekly and prepare vegetables and fruits for their lunch. 
Educators regularly share healthy food and hygiene information with parents. Safety education is enhanced and 
children are supervised at all times.</p>
<p><b>Intentional Teaching:</b> Educators focus on intentional teaching based on children’s interests, abilities
 and home experience and provide structured learning to foster children’s social, emotional, intellectual and
 motor skills and language development, in accordance with the Early Years Learning Framework.</p>
<p><b>Play-based Learning:</b> Educators value play-based learning as this gives children the best opportunity 
to discover, create, improvise, imagine and develop a positive disposition towards learning.</p>
<p><b>Parents Involvement:</b> we are welcome parents to involve in policy and procedure development, curriculum 
decision making and participating in classroom activities and cultural celebrations. We encourage parents to
 attend parent meetings during the year.</p>
