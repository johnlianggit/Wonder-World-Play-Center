        <p> Earth is the home for everyone and each of us, individually, should take care of it. Wonder World Play 
		Centre has installed two rainwater tanks for our educational programme. The children use the rainwater for
		gardening, rinsing fruit and vegetable scraps into compost bins and sorting out items for the recycling
		bin. They also learn that food is precious and should not be wasted. The Centre uses a lot of recycled
		materials in our programme, such as glass, paper and cardboard. </p>
