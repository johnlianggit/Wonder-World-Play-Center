	   <h3> "Doing" is learning </h3> 
	   <p>Children participate in 
	   a range of wholesome and home-based activities including cooking, gardening, sweeping leaves, washing and 
	   hanging up their play materials to dry, cutting up vegetable and fruit scraps for the chickens, feeding the
	   chickens and turtles, and checking for chicken eggs. These hands-on experiences foster children’s 
	   understanding of responsibilities and provide general knowledge and skills for living. Each day children 
	   come together for circle time and story time, where they sing songs, recite verses and listen to stories.
	   Children also share stories from home. There are many structured art and craft activities to enhance 
	   children’s creativity and imagination, such as threading, making toys with yarn, modelling, painting and 
	   dancing and music movement.</p>
<p>Our home corner, construction corner and open play areas provide rich spaces and materials for children to 
interact with. Materials are natural and carefully selected to have artistic features.</p>
