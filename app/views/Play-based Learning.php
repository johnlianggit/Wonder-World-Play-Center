		<p><b>Play is a child’s work.</b> Children find their own learning situation in play. Play strengthens the
		imagination-essential for scientific exploration. Creative play supports physical, emotional and 
		social development and allows children to learn through investigation, exploration and discovery.</p>
       <p> The Centre’s home corner, construction corner and open play areas provide rich spaces and materials for 
		children to interact with. Materials are natural and carefully selected with artistic features. Free play
		provides social, emotional, intellectual, language, imaginative and creative opportunities for growth and 
		discovery.</p>
<p>The children choose what they want to play and who they want to play with. They have fun in their play and are
 able to interact with their peers, spaces and materials with enthusiasm and enjoyment. Play also helps children 
 to develop a love of learning.</p>
<p>At Wonder World Play Centre, teachers and educators guide and extend children’s play activities, continually
 evaluating their play to discover what the children are learning and helping to shape and extend this learning.</p>
