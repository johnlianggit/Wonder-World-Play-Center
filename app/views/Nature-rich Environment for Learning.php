		<h3>Exposure to natural environments improves children’s cognitive development by improving their awareness, 
		reasoning and observational skills (Pyle 2002).</h3>
       <p><b>Wonder World Play Centre</b> provides a rich environment in which children can learn about nature. 
	   In springtime the children sow seeds for flowers and vegetables. The children have abundant opportunities 
	   to observe fruit trees blossoming and then producing fruit that grows bigger and gradually ripens.
	   In spring, children express wonder at so many bees and butterflies being on flowers in our playground.
	   In summer, children enjoy sitting under the plum tree eating juicy plums; in autumn they see the maple
	   tree leaves turn red and large numbers of apples ripen on the apple trees. Our apples last several months
	   for the children to enjoy. All year round children learn to take care of their garden, plants and trees.
	   Diverse birds using our nature-rich environment also bring joy to the children’s lives. </p>
