     <p> To help children to develop healthy eating habits and a love of food we provide a weekly cooking experience
	  and discuss with them the nutritional value of the food they eat. We also allow children to prepare lunch 
	  activities. The children are motivated to try new food and we always have fresh fruit from families’ and 
	  educators’ homes as well as from our garden.</p>
<h3>Morning and Afternoon Tea</h3>
<p>The children have a variety of fruit with water-based crackers and baked bread.</p>
<h3>Lunch</h3>
<p>The children learn the value of good nutrition and make choices by preparing lunch alongside the educators.
The educators help children to make sandwiches with salad, eggs or tuna for lunch, which are followed by fruits 
and yoghurt. Educators and children together also regularly cook soups, porridge and various breads for their 
lunch and tea.</p>
<h3>Drink</h3>
<p>Children are encouraged to bring a bottle and drink plenty of water during the day; after each meal, children 
are encouraged to drink water to rinse their teeth.</p>
<p>The children drink milk at afternoon tea time.</p>
